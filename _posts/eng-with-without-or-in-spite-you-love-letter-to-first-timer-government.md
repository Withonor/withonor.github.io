#  With, without or in spite you. Love letter to the first-timer government.

Cyber Monday is a terrific day for this first delivery.

And even for those of us who work everyday, I think it's also natural when talking about business that Monday night is a common moment to connect visions of the past, present and future. 
We are a few days away from the official takeover and you have probably noticed during the months after the 1st of July that people are nervous and impatient to see what will happen. I do not worry too much or wish anyone misfortune because of being from one party or another, those who know me closely know that I have family inside the PRI, in MORENA, in the PAN, PRD, Movimiento Ciudadano [Citizen Movement], Partido del Trabajo [Labor Party], Republicans, Democrats,,, whatever it is, name the party and I have family there, don't we all?
   You may actually be just as I am, a little sick of all those who express prisimism, which is a kind of low breed between cynicism, pessimism and traumas of the past: they say that everything will continue the same or worse because some members of other parties joined to the winning party... that's where the term 'prisimism' comes from, many others even reveal some ignorance by demanding changes overnight even though the new regime has not even officially taken the position they won.
   Some simplify everything by saying: «I put you where you are and I can also take you away» and it is true: being God or a simple human voter citizen, in democracy the truth of that phrase remains true to the test of any logic, and this is a democracy after all, but although removing a regime is possible, it would be possible, at what cost?
   The phrase, besides being true, is loaded with a confrontational connotation and confrontation... hmm... to enter into that topic would be a waste of time, in this text and in reality. And that is the point of this statement. Enough time wasting, let's build.
   
   And to build large companies and sustain their growth by thriving over time, we need to surround ourselves with people who know how to adapt to any situation, whether they aspire to be as big as DuPont, or as small as an ancient Spa hot springs that exists in Japan, there are few companies that pass the test of time to have at least more than one hundred years old or leave any legacy like both mentioned companies have. I bet you can guess right which one is older.
   
   What we all really need are people who seek productive alliances and share their respect for the value of your business and find opportunities for those who are in tune with peace and life.
   
   Software companies understand well that term that I mentioned before and the cost of such thing, the 'technical debt' is manifested in the public administration; badly organized, neglected and even sabotaged by its own members, favoritistic, full of individuals who let the tiny power of bureau that's given to them for being public officials go up and above their heads. In any case, the ally that suits you is the one who can deal with any type of technical debt to which your company is exposed.
   
   Analyzing root cause is something that I've liked since childhood, it's like a hobby. Whenever I've seen companies having sustainable success, analyzing them through time I was left with some impressions; After a couple of decades of comparison and experience, I came to the conclusion that the element that leads businesses to prosper is a spiritual element, which often manifests itself in a pacifist attitude sometimes confused with humility, reserved but deliberate, to which first powerful dose we can encapsulate within the phrase that this text carries as a title: ˆWith, without or despite youˆ is the perspective of someone who does not spend energy fighting but finding ways to advance projects, moving forward to the goals along with benefits for their allies and benefactors. And they surround themselves with people with that same impetus.
   Of course, as I mentioned before, the government is only a useful example as an interchangeable subject for practical purposes in this communiqué: working with the government or with anyone can be better if attitudes are coupled and lent, and that's why the "With you" is in first place in that motto.
   
   «With, without or in spite of you» Is not a break up phrase, it is a peaceful and kind way of saying "excuse me I'm already passing through", it is an invitation to make alliances with leaders who emanate that impetus, and if someone gets offended without reason, it is also an open door to reconciliation, working as a team is better for everyone. Well, it brings us abundance.
